You have to climb the empire stte building. You roll a dice 100 times. If the numbers 1,2 come up then you climb down a step(you cannot go below 0). If the numbers 3,4,5 come up then you go a step up. If the number 6 comes up then you throw it again and climb that many steps. Also you are a bit clumsy and the chances of falling down to zero is 0.1%. What is probability that you climb step 60 or up.
